  This project utilizes a **Rule-Based** approach, employing a series of if-else statements to make decisions and generate responses based on input conditions.
  It also use Threading for multiple threading and schedule for scheduling events and other scripts.

  > [!NOTE]
  >The rule_based_ai function takes user input (input_data) and applies a series of if-else statements to determine the appropriate response.
    Each if-else block represents a rule. For instance, if the input contains the word "hello," the AI responds with a greeting. If it contains "bye," the AI bids farewell. If     "weather" is present, the AI provides a weather-related response. If none of these conditions are met, a default response is given.
    You can customize and extend this logic to suit the specific requirements of your AI. Consider adding more rules, incorporating additional conditions, or adjusting the         responses based on your project's objectives.

  > ### Rule-Based AI Algorithm  
  ```
  def rule_based_ai(input_data):
      # Example rules
      if "hello" in input_data:
          return "Hi there! How can I help you?"
      elif "bye" in input_data:
          return "Goodbye! Have a great day."
      elif "weather" in input_data:
          return "The weather is currently sunny and warm."
      else:
          return "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please provide more information?"
  
  # Example Usage
  user_input = input("User: ")
  response = rule_based_ai(user_input)
  print("AI:", response)
  ```

## NOTE
This voice-controlled assistant is my first-year engineering project. It’s been a great learning experience, and I’m proud of what I’ve achieved so far. While this is just the beginning, I’m excited to improve it in the future and create an even smarter, more advanced assistant. Stay tuned for what’s next!
